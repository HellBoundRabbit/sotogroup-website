# CloudKit Routes System Setup - Multi-Job Design

## üóÇÔ∏è Required CloudKit Record Types

You need to create **TWO** record types in your CloudKit dashboard:

### Record Type 1: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESRoutes`

| Field Name | Field Type | Indexed | Description |
|------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `routeIdString` | STRING | Queryable | Unique route identifier |
| `userIdString` | STRING | Queryable | User who created the route |
| `routeNameString` | STRING | None | Human-readable route name |
| `driverNameString` | STRING | None | Driver assigned to route |
| `driverLocationString` | STRING | None | Driver's location/postcode |
| `totalJobsInt64` | INT64 | None | Total number of jobs in this route |
| `totalDistanceDouble` | DOUBLE | None | Total route distance in miles |
| `estimatedDurationInt64` | INT64 | None | Estimated duration in minutes |
| `statusString` | STRING | None | Route status (active/completed/cancelled) |
| `createdAtTimestamp` | TIMESTAMP | None | When route was created |
| `updatedAtTimestamp` | TIMESTAMP | None | Last update time |

### Record Type 2: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESJobs`

| Field Name | Field Type | Indexed | Description |
|------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `jobIdString` | STRING | Queryable | Unique job identifier |
| `routeIdString` | STRING | Queryable | Parent route ID |
| `jobNumberInt64` | INT64 | None | Job sequence number (1, 2, 3...) |
| `collectionAddressString` | STRING | None | Collection address for this job |
| `deliveryAddressString` | STRING | None | Delivery address for this job |
| `collectionPostcodeString` | STRING | None | Collection postcode |
| `deliveryPostcodeString` | STRING | None | Delivery postcode |
| `jobPriceDouble` | DOUBLE | None | Price for this individual job |
| `jobDistanceDouble` | DOUBLE | None | Distance for this job segment |
| `jobDurationInt64` | INT64 | None | Duration for this job segment |
| `jobNotesString` | STRING | None | Notes for this specific job |
| `isCompletedBoolean` | BOOLEAN | None | Whether this job is completed |
| `createdAtTimestamp` | TIMESTAMP | None | When job was created |

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Go to your CloudKit Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Record Types**
3. **Create Record Type 1**: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESRoutes`
   - Click the "+" button to create new record type
   - Name it: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESRoutes`
   - Add each field from the first table above
   - Set indexes as specified (Queryable for `routeIdString` and `userIdString`)
   - Save the record type
4. **Create Record Type 2**: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESJobs`
   - Click the "+" button to create another record type
   - Name it: `SOTOWebsiteROUTESJobs`
   - Add each field from the second table above
   - Set indexes as specified (Queryable for `jobIdString` and `routeIdString`)
   - Save the record type

## ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented

- ‚úÖ **Multi-job routes system** with separate route and job records
- ‚úÖ **Routes page updated** to use CloudKit instead of localStorage
- ‚úÖ **Server-side API endpoints** for multi-job routes management:
  - `POST /api/routes/save` - Save routes and jobs to CloudKit
  - `GET /api/routes/get/<user_id>` - Get user's routes with all jobs
  - `POST /api/routes/clear/<user_id>` - Clear user's routes and jobs
- ‚úÖ **CloudKit integration** using your existing configuration
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** and fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Cross-device sync** for routes and jobs

## üöÄ Benefits

- **Multiple jobs per route** - Each route can contain unlimited individual jobs
- **Individual job tracking** - Track completion status, pricing, and details per job
- **Flexible job management** - Add/remove jobs without affecting route structure
- **Cross-device sync** - Routes and jobs available on any device
- **Backup & recovery** - Never lose routes or job data
- **Multi-user support** - Different users can have separate routes and jobs
- **Scalability** - No browser storage limits, cloud-based storage
- **Detailed analytics** - Track performance per job and per route
- **Consistent with existing quote system** - Uses same CloudKit patterns

## üß™ Testing

Once you've created the record type in CloudKit:

1. **Start the server**: `python3 server.py`
2. **Visit**: `http://localhost:8000/pages/routes.html`
3. **Click "Optimise"** to create and save routes
4. **Check the counter** shows saved routes
5. **Click "Clear All Routes"** to delete them
6. **Verify in CloudKit dashboard** that records are created/deleted

## üîó Integration with Existing System

This routes system integrates seamlessly with your existing:
- **CloudKit configuration** (same container, same auth)
- **Server infrastructure** (same Flask app, same patterns)
- **UI/UX** (same dark theme, same styling)
- **Error handling** (same patterns as quote system)

The implementation follows the exact same patterns as your existing quote system, making it consistent and maintainable!
